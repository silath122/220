Hello,

It's Siah! I just wanted to see how you are doing.
How's New York so far?
Have you been to the Empire State Building?
I've always wanted to go there!
Matter of fact, I am trying to plan a trip with my family.
Let me know when you're free during the summer, so we can
meet up and get dinner.
Anyways, love and miss you.

Love,

Siah Thomas
